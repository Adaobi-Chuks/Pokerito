# Pokerito
Pokerito is like Poker, but the rules are a lot simpler. This was written with Java and a nice complicated game to test my Java skills so far.

The rules are as follows:

The dealer will give the player one card.

And the dealer will give the computer one card.

Then, the dealer will draw five cards (the river).

The player with the most river matches wins. 

If the matches are equal, everyone's a winner!
